### Submission Format
Each line of the submitted file contains a list of the top 100 matches from the gallery set for each query, in ascending order of their distance to the query. The delimiter is space. Each match should be represented as its index (from 00000 to 24005 for the test set). 

More specifically, the first line of submission file is corresponding to the top 100 matches (represented as indices) of the first query (index=0000); the second line is corresponding to the second query (idex=0001).
